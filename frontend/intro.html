        <p class="skinny"> You know the feeling all too well. There you are, chatting with business associates at an upscale watering hole, 
            or participating in a little good-natured give-and-take during a golf or tennis match, 
            or relaxing with friends on the beach, or maybe just reviewing the day with your family at the 
            supper table. You spot an opportunity to liven up the discussion with a particularly pithy observation in Latin, 
            and then, all of a sudden, you’re assailed by paralyzing doubts. 
        
            <p class="skinny"> Does the verb you were planning to use belong in the second or third conjugation? Is it irregular? Deponent? Reflexive? Defective? 
            Does it take ut and a subjunctive or an infinitive with the accusative? Or, worse still, does it take the dative, or the genitive? Would a gerundive construction be more appropriate, 
            or laughably awkward? How about a passive periphrastic or—but no, it’s too late. The moment has passed; the conversation has moved on. </p>

            <p class="skinny"> Now, be honest—how many times has that happened to you? If your answer is saepius (all too often)—and we bet it is!—then  Lingua Latina Occasionibus 
            Omnibus (Latin for All Occasions) is the book for you.</p>
            <p class="skinny"> Here, in one handy, easy-to-use, toga-totable papyrus-back book, are hundreds of everyday English expressions rendered into grammatically accurate, idiomatically correct classical Latin, just as you would have translated them yourself if you had the time. And all of these practical phrases are conveniently organized into familiar conversational categories so you can be confident that in any social situation some suitable Latin bona dicta (bon mots) will be right at your fingertips, just as they would be if only you could get in a little more practice” </p>

            <p class="skinny"> The next time you feel like using the immortal language of Caesar and Cicero to turn an ordinary remark into a timeless utterace, don't let <span><i>feles</i></span> (the cat) get your tongue. With a copy of this handy little volume tucked in your sleeve (or in the bag carried by the faithful retainer walking a respectful two paces behind you), you'll never again be intimidated by those seven hundred verb endings, ninety noun cases, and twenty kinds of ablative. And you'll quickly discover that whether you want to impress the boss, entertain your friends, keep the kids in line, or charm that special someone, speaking Latin is as easy as taking Gaul from the Gauls</p>

            <p class="skinny"> <i><span> Vince!</span></i> (Knock 'em dead!) </p>
